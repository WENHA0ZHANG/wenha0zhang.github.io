Wenhao Zhang is a second-year Ph.D. student from [Department of The Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). His research interest includes occupant-centric controls and indoor thermal comfort. He currently works on just-in-time adaptive intervention for indoor comfort, dynamic bedroom environment optimization during sleep, and cold-start personal comfort model design. Before joining the NUS, he worked at [DesignBuilder Software Ltd](https://designbuilder.co.uk/), where he was responsible for developing training content for DesignBuilder scripting tools.

He is currently supervised by [Prof. Clayton Miller](https://cis.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/8346/clayton-miller) of [BUDS (Building and Urban Data Science) Lab](https://budslab.org/) from Singapore Management University, [Prof. Adrian Chong](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/staff/adrian-chong-dr/) of [IDEAS (Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation) Lab](https://ideaslab.io/) from the National University of Singapore, and [Prof. Stefano Schiavon](https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/stefano-schiavon) from the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, he was advised by [Dr. Rui Tang](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82724) from the University College London, and [Dr. Zhiang Zhang](https://research.nottingham.edu.cn/en/persons/zhiang-zhang) from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China.
