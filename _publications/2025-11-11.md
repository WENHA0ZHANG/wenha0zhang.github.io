**Abstract:** Sleep is essential for human health and well-being. Previous lab-based studies have shown that dynamically adjusting bedroom temperature according to body thermoregulation can improve sleep quality and thermal satisfaction. However, such strategies have not been tested in real-world settings, and there is a lack of practical solutions developed for residential buildings. In this work, we evaluate a body thermoregulation-based dynamic air conditioning (AC) control strategy designed for typical Singapore homes in a pilot field deployment. The preliminary findings suggest that the proposed strategy can be successfully implemented in real bedroom environments and may improve sleep outcomes.
