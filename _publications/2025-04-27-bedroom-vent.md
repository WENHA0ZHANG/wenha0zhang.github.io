**Abstract:** This study investigated bedroom ventilation and air quality in Singapore's tropical climate. Comfort parameters along with multiple air pollutants were measured in seven bedrooms, each for approximately one month. The median bedroom ventilation rate with the interquartile range was 6.2 [3.4-23.1] L/s/p during sleep, and the CO2 concentration was 727 [516-1232] ppm. Both often did not meet the established standard requirements. TVOCs, formaldehyde, and PM2.5 levels remained below existing standards. The median temperature and relative humidity were 28.9 [27.9-29.7] °C and 77 [67-80] %, respectively. The bedroom light intensity during sleep was below 50 lux. Opening windows and doors improved ventilation and reduced CO₂ concentration but increased sound pressure level, frequently surpassing the standard limit. These preliminary findings indicate that existing bedrooms in Singapore might be insufficiently ventilated, and there is a potential need to balance fresh air supply with thermal comfort and noise control for better sleep and well-being.
